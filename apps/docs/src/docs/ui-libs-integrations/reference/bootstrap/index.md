# Bootstrap Integration

> **Status: Coming Soon** 🚧
> Bootstrap integration for ng-forge dynamic forms is currently in development. Check back soon for updates!

## What's Planned

The Bootstrap integration will provide:

- **Bootstrap-styled form controls** - All native Bootstrap form components
- **Validation feedback** - Bootstrap validation states and error styling
- **Responsive grid integration** - Bootstrap's 12-column grid system
- **Theme customization** - Support for Bootstrap themes and variables
- **Form layouts** - Bootstrap form groups, horizontal and inline forms

## In the Meantime

While we complete the Bootstrap integration, you have two options:

### 1. Use the Material Integration

The **[Material Design integration](../material)** is production-ready and fully documented. It provides the same features and can be a great starting point.

### 2. Build Your Own Integration

Follow our **[Custom Integration Guide](../../guide)** to create Bootstrap field components yourself. The guide includes examples from the Material integration showing how to implement field components, type safety, and validation.
