# PrimeNG Integration

> **Status: Coming Soon** 🚧
> PrimeNG integration for ng-forge dynamic forms is currently in development. Check back soon for updates!

## What's Planned

The PrimeNG integration will provide:

- **Complete PrimeNG component library** - All PrimeNG form components
- **Rich UI components** - AutoComplete, Calendar, MultiSelect, Chips, and more
- **Theme support** - Built-in PrimeNG themes (Lara, Material, Bootstrap)
- **Advanced data components** - TreeSelect, Cascading Selects, advanced tables
- **PrimeIcons integration** - Icon support throughout forms

## In the Meantime

While we complete the PrimeNG integration, you have two options:

### 1. Use the Material Integration

The **[Material Design integration](../material)** is production-ready and fully documented. It provides the same features and can be a great starting point.

### 2. Build Your Own Integration

You can create PrimeNG field components using our integration system. The **[Material integration source code](https://github.com/ng-forge/ng-forge/tree/main/packages/dynamic-form-material)** serves as a complete reference implementation:

- **Field Components**: See how Material components are implemented
- **Type Safety**: Module augmentation patterns for custom props
- **Validation Integration**: How Material displays validation errors
- **Field Mappers**: Registration and configuration patterns

Start with the **[Custom Integration Guide](../../guide)** which walks through the process step-by-step.
