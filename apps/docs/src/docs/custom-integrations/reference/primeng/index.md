# PrimeNG Integration

> **Status: Coming Soon** 🚧
> PrimeNG integration for ng-forge dynamic forms is currently in development. Check back soon for updates!

## What's Planned

The PrimeNG integration will provide:

- **Complete PrimeNG component library** - All PrimeNG form components
- **Rich UI components** - AutoComplete, Calendar, MultiSelect, Chips, and more
- **Theme support** - Built-in PrimeNG themes (Lara, Material, Bootstrap)
- **Advanced data components** - TreeSelect, Cascading Selects, advanced tables
- **PrimeIcons integration** - Icon support throughout forms

## In the Meantime

While we complete the PrimeNG integration, you have two options:

### 1. Use the Material Integration

The **[Material Design integration](../material)** is production-ready and fully documented. It provides the same features and can be a great starting point.

### 2. Build Your Own Integration

Follow our **[Custom Integration Guide](../../guide)** to create PrimeNG field components yourself. The guide includes:

- Step-by-step integration process
- Type-safe component creation
- Props and validation handling
- Complete working examples
