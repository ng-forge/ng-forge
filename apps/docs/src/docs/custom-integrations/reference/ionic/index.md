# Ionic Integration

> **Status: Coming Soon** 🚧
> Ionic integration for ng-forge dynamic forms is currently in development. Check back soon for updates!

## What's Planned

The Ionic integration will provide:

- **Ionic mobile-first components** - All native Ionic form components
- **iOS and Android styling** - Platform-specific styling (Material on Android, iOS native on iOS)
- **Touch-optimized controls** - Large touch targets, swipe gestures
- **Mobile gestures support** - Pull-to-refresh, slide-to-delete, and more
- **Ionic icons** - Full Ionicons integration

## In the Meantime

While we complete the Ionic integration, you have two options:

### 1. Use the Material Integration

The **[Material Design integration](../material)** is production-ready and fully documented. It provides the same features and works well on mobile with proper viewport configuration.

### 2. Build Your Own Integration

Follow our **[Custom Integration Guide](../../guide)** to create Ionic field components yourself. The guide includes:

- Step-by-step integration process
- Type-safe component creation
- Props and validation handling
- Complete working examples
