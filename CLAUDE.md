# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the `nx_workspace` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the `nx_project_details` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the `nx_docs` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the `nx_workspace` tool to get any errors

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.
You will use functions from lodash and date-fns whenever the situation suits it.

## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
    - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.
## Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
## State Management
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
