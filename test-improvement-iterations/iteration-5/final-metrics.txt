=== AFTER ITERATION 5 ===
Weak assertions (toBeDefined): 43
Weak assertions (boolean): 33 (excluding comments)
Total weak assertions: 76

Improvement from Iteration 5 baseline:
- Started with: 90 total weak assertions (43 + 47)
- Fixed: 14 weak assertions (all edge case tests)
- Remaining: 76 weak assertions (-14)

Note: Significant improvement in edge case coverage - critical for production robustness!
